# Game of Thrones House



A simple, badass website that describes the houses in the Game of Thrones for those who are new to watching the show and keep getting confused between the houses. Click on each of the shield to learn about the respective House of Stark, Lannister and others in short descriptions with certainly lesser characters than Game of Thrones. There is no comic but there is definitely Sansa. If you know nothing, like Jon Snow, this is absolutely the best place for you to start being a part of the fandom. It's certainly more fun than the Red Wedding here.
